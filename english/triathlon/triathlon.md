You were always intrigued by endurance sports. 
So you head over to wikipedia and look up triathlon. 
It happens to be one of the most demanding endurance events in the world. 
The full distance entails 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and 26.2 mile run. 
You're hooked with the challenge. 
You click on the [IRONMAN](http://www.ironman.com) link on the wikipedia page.
There happens to be a race very close to you and you sign up.
What the hell did I just do?
You suddenly realize that the race is in just 2 months, then you research
and find out that most athletes spend years training for this!!
Too bad there wasn't a refund option when signing up...
